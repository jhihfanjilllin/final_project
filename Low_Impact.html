        <h2>Low-Impact Workouts</h2>
        <p>
          Low-impact workouts are exercises that minimize the stress on joints while still providing a substantial cardiovascular and strength-training effect. These types of workouts are ideal for individuals who may be recovering from an injury, have joint concerns, or simply prefer gentler forms of exercise. Low-impact workouts are accessible to a wide range of fitness levels and can be modified for various intensities.
        </p>
        
          <h3><li>Swimming, Cycling, Walking</li></h3>
          <p>
            Swimming, cycling, and walking involve fluid, non-jarring movements that allow the body to exercise efficiently without putting excessive strain on the joints. Swimming engages multiple muscle groups, cycling helps strengthen the lower body, and walking is a simple yet effective full-body exercise.
          </p>
          <h4>Benefits of Abdominal workouts:</h4>
          <ul>
        <li>Improving endurance and cardiovascular health</li>
        <li>Strengthening muscles and bones</li>
        <li>The flexibility to be done solo or in groups</li>
        <li>Customizable intensity levels to suit individual fitness goals</li>
        <li>Low risk of injury, making them suitable for long-term fitness routines</li>
    </ul>
          
          <h3>Elliptical or rowing machine routines</h3>
          <p>Elliptical and rowing machine workouts offer low-impact cardiovascular training that engages multiple muscle groups. The elliptical machine simulates walking or running while reducing the impact on joints, making it ideal for people looking to protect their knees and hips. The rowing machine provides a full-body workout, emphasizing the upper body, core, and legs through controlled pulling motions.
          </p>
          <h3>Yoga or Tai Chi</h3>
          <p>Yoga and Tai Chi are gentle, low-impact practices that focus on mindful movement, flexibility, and inner strength. Yoga combines breath control, stretching, and balance, while Tai Chi incorporates slow, flowing movements that promote relaxation and coordination.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>Benefits of Yoga/ Tai Chi</h4>
        <li>Enhancing flexibility and balance</li>
        <li>Reducing stress and promoting relaxation</li>
        <li>Supporting joint health and improving range of motion</li>
        <li>Boosting overall mental well-being</li>
