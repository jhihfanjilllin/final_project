    <h2>Strength Training</h2>
    <p>
        Strength training is a crucial component of any fitness routine, helping to build muscle, increase strength, 
        and improve overall body composition. Incorporating a variety of strength-based exercises ensures a balanced 
        approach to fitness, whether youâ€™re using your bodyweight, free weights, or resistance bands. Below are some 
        effective strength training options to consider:
    </p>
    
    <h3>Bodyweight Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Bodyweight exercises use your own weight to provide resistance, making them an accessible and effective way 
        to build strength without any equipment. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups, improving both strength 
        and endurance.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Popular Bodyweight Exercises:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Push-ups:</strong> A classic upper-body exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. 
            Push-ups can be modified for any fitness level, from beginner to advanced.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Squats:</strong> A powerful lower-body exercise that works the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core. 
            Squats improve leg strength, mobility, and balance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits of Bodyweight Exercises:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>No equipment needed</li>
        <li>Can be done anywhere</li>
        <li>Improves functional strength and flexibility</li>
        <li>Scalable for all fitness levels (e.g., modifying push-ups or squats)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weightlifting Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Weightlifting exercises are essential for building muscle strength, enhancing endurance, and improving overall physical health. They can be performed using various types of equipment, such as dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells, and weight machines, allowing individuals to target different muscle groups effectively. Incorporating weightlifting into a fitness routine promotes bone density, boosts metabolism, and helps in maintaining a healthy weight.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Popular Weightlifting Exercises:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dumbbells:</strong> Dumbbell exercises are versatile and can be used to target specific muscles or perform compound movements. Popular exercises include bicep curls, shoulder presses, and bench presses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Kettlebells:</strong> Kettlebells offer dynamic resistance training that focuses on strength, endurance, and functional movement. Common kettlebell exercises include swings, goblet squats, and Turkish get-ups.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits of Weightlifting Exercises:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased muscle strength and tone</li>
        <li>Enhanced metabolic rate and calorie burning</li>
        <li>Improved bone density and joint support</li>
        <li>Boosted mental health and reduced stress</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resistance Bands</h3>
    <p>
        Resistance bands are elastic bands that provide a different type of resistance compared to traditional weights. They are portable, affordable, and ideal for workouts that require low-impact strength training. These bands can be used for various exercises, such as squats, leg extensions, and arm workouts, making them perfect for home or travel use.
    </p>

        <li>Improves flexibility, balance, and functional strength</li>
