        <h2>Core & Stability</h2>
        <p>
          Core and stability exercises are vital for maintaining balance, supporting proper posture, and enhancing overall functional strength. A strong core contributes to better athletic performance, helps prevent injuries, and supports daily movements. Training that targets the core involves not only the abdominal muscles but also the lower back, hips, and pelvis, ensuring comprehensive stability.
        </p>
        
          <h3>Abdominal workouts</h3>
          <p>
            Abdominal workouts involve a variety of exercises designed to strengthen the muscles of the abdomen, including the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis. Popular abdominal exercises include crunches, leg raises, and Russian twists, which focus on building core strength and muscle tone.
          </p>
          <h4>Benefits of Abdominal workouts:</h4>
          <ul>
        <li>Improved core stability and posture</li>
        <li>Enhanced balance and coordination</li>
        <li>Reduced risk of back pain by supporting the spine</li>
        <li>Better performance in physical activities</li>
    </ul>
          <h3>Planks and Balance Exercises</h3>
          <p>These classic forms of core and stability training are highly effective for engaging multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Planks target the entire core, including the back and shoulders, while various balance exercises, such as single-leg stands or stability ball activities, help improve proprioception and muscular endurance.</p>
        </ul>

        <h4>Benefits of Planks and Balance Exercises</h4>
        <li>Strengthened core muscles and improved endurance</li>
        <li>Enhanced balance and body control</li>
        <li>Increased overall body stability, which reduces the risk of falls and injuries</li>
        <li>Activation of deep stabilizing muscles for better functional movement</li>
